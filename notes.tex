\subsection{Introduction}
The Karaka system serves as the basis for description of Panini's Syntax. It is a syntacito-semantic representation of the relations between the verb and the direct participants of the action in the sentence.
\subsection{Definitions}
Panini's work is explained, extended, commented and reinterpreted by many authors like kAtyayana, patanjali, bhartrhari and others. This section includes some of the definitions of the ``kAraka".

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Patanjali}, in his Mahabhashya defines ``kAraka" as ``karOti iti" ( ``The one that does" )
 \item The author of \textbf{kAsika} explains it as being synonymous to ``hEtu" and ``nimitta"  (Cause) - ``kArakam hEtur ity anarthAntaram" ( `` Cause and kArakam are one and the same " )
 \item \textbf{Bhartrhari} uses the term ``sAdhanam" to specify kAraka as the one capable of establishing action which is given the term ``sAdhya".
 \item \textbf{NagEsa} defines kAraka as the one that producces the action. 
\end{itemize}

Therefore, we may say that kAraka is a animate/inanimate, passively/actively involved entity in the acomplishment of an action. The relations between the verb ( ``kriya" ) and the kAraka are of the type visheshaNa - visheshya ( Modifier - Modified ).

There are six kArakas. They are specified below briefly. ( Written as per the order )

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{apAdAnam}  :  Defined as \textit{``dhruvam apAye pAdAnam"} - The Entity which remains constant when seperation takes place
    \item \textbf{sampradAnam}  : \textit{``karmaNA yam abhipraiti sa sampradAnam"} - Is the entity for which the karma is intended. 
    \item \textbf{karaNam} : Is defined as the most effective means of accomplishing the action - `\textit{`sAhakatamam karaNam"}
    \item \textbf{adhikaraNam} : \textit{``AdhAro' dhikaraNam"} - Specifies the location an time of the activity.
    \item \textbf{karma} :  
    \item \textbf{karta} : \textit{``svatantrAh karta"} - This is the entity which is considered by the speaker as the most independent of all the other kArakAs in an activity.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Examples}
Consider the following sentence and its respective dependency relations.
\begin{center}
\begin{dependency}[arc edge, arc angle=80, text only label, label style={above}]
   \begin{deptext}[column sep=1em]
      dEvadattah \& kAshTaih \& sthAlyAm \& tAnDulAn \& pacati \\
      dEvadatta [NOM] \& with Firewood [INS] \& in the vessel [LOC] \& rice [ACC]  \& cooks \\
   \end{deptext}
   \deproot{5}{ROOT}
   \depedge{5}{1}{karta}
   \depedge{5}{2}{karaNa}
   \depedge{5}{3}{dEshAdhikaraNa}
   \depedge{5}{4}{karma}
\end{dependency} 

 `` dEvadatta cooks the rice with the firewood in the vessel " \\
\end{center}


\section{Some theorems and stuff} % Don't be this informal in your notes!

We now delve right into the proof.

\begin{lemma}
This is the first lemma of the lecture.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The proof is by induction on $\ldots$.
For fun, we throw in a figure.
%%%NOTE USAGE !
\fig{1}{1in}{A Fun Figure}

This is the end of the proof, which is marked with a little box.
\end{proof}

\subsection{A few items of note}

Here is an itemized list:
\begin{itemize}
\item this is the first item;
\item this is the second item.
\end{itemize}

Here is an enumerated list:
\begin{enumerate}
\item this is the first item;
\item this is the second item.
\end{enumerate}

Here is an exercise:

{\bf Exercise:}  Show that ${\rm P}\ne{\rm NP}$.

Here is how to define things in the proper mathematical style.
Let $f_k$ be the $AND-OR$ function, defined by

\[ f_k(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{2^k}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}

	x_1 & \mbox{if $k = 0$;} \\

	AND(f_{k-1}(x_1, \ldots, x_{2^{k-1}}),
	   f_{k-1}(x_{2^{k-1} + 1}, \ldots, x_{2^k}))
	 & \mbox{if $k$ is even;} \\

	OR(f_{k-1}(x_1, \ldots, x_{2^{k-1}}),
	   f_{k-1}(x_{2^{k-1} + 1}, \ldots, x_{2^k}))	
	& \mbox{otherwise.} 
	\end{array}
	\right. \]

\begin{theorem}
This is the first theorem.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
This is the proof of the first theorem. We show how to write pseudo-code now.
%*** USE PSEUDO-CODE ONLY IF IT IS CLEARER THAN AN ENGLISH DESCRIPTION

Consider a comparison between $x$ and~$y$:
\begin{tabbing}
\hspace*{.25in} \= \hspace*{.25in} \= \hspace*{.25in} \= \hspace*{.25in} \= \hspace*{.25in} \=\kill
\>{\bf if} $x$ or $y$ or both are in $S$ {\bf then } \\
\>\> answer accordingly \\
\>{\bf else} \\
\>\>    Make the element with the larger score (say $x$) win the comparison \\
\>\> {\bf if} $F(x) + F(y) < \frac{n}{t-1}$ {\bf then} \\%
\>\>\> $F(x) \leftarrow F(x) + F(y)$ \\
\>\>\> $F(y) \leftarrow 0$ \\
\>\> {\bf else}  \\
\>\>\> $S \leftarrow S \cup \{ x \} $ \\
\>\>\> $r \leftarrow r+1$ \\
\>\> {\bf endif} \\
\>{\bf endif} 
\end{tabbing}

This concludes the proof.
\end{proof}
